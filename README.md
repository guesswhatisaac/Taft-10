Taft 10: Food Review Platform
==============================
A community platform where food lovers come together to share their experiences, recommendations, and tips.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

üåü PROJECT OVERVIEW
------------------

"Taft 10" is a full-stack web application that serves as a platform for food reviews. It allows users to create accounts, browse food establishments, and post their own reviews. The platform also provides features for establishment owners to manage their pages and reply directly to customer feedback. Key functionalities include user authentication (sign-up, sign-in, sign-out), profile editing, and full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for both reviews and establishments.

The live website can be viewed here: https://taft10.onrender.com/guest-view
